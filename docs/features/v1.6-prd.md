# v1.6.0 PRD: Remote Config Inheritance

## Overview

Version 1.6.0 implements remote ruleset inheritance, allowing projects to extend base configurations from remote git repositories. This enables organizations to maintain centralized coding standards that projects can inherit and optionally extend.

## Problem Statement

Without remote config inheritance:

- Each repo has its own `cmc.toml` with its own rules
- Org-wide rule changes require manually updating every repo
- No enforcement prevents teams from weakening standards
- No version control for ruleset rollouts

With remote config inheritance:

- Base rules live in one central repository
- Projects inherit them automatically via `[extends]`
- Conflict detection prevents weakening inherited rules
- Version pinning enables controlled rollouts

## Current State

The codebase already has:

- `[extends]` schema defined in `src/config/loader.ts` (lines 79-92)
- Remote fetcher in `src/remote/fetcher.ts` supporting `github:owner/repo/path@version`
- `rulesets.json` manifest format in private repo with version resolution
- Partial TOML ruleset files (e.g., `[rulesets.eslint.rules]` only)

What's missing:

- Runtime resolution of `[extends]` references
- Fetching and parsing remote ruleset files
- Merging remote rules with local rules
- Conflict detection and error reporting
- Integration with `check`, `generate`, and `audit` commands

## Features

### 1. Remote Ruleset Resolution

#### Description

When loading `cmc.toml`, resolve `[extends]` references by fetching remote ruleset files and merging them with local configuration.

#### Config Format

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"

[extends]
eslint = "github:myorg/standards/rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint@main"
tsc = "github:myorg/standards/rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/tsc@main"
ruff = "github:myorg/standards/rulesets/internal/python/3.12/ruff@v1.0.0"

# Local rules are merged with inherited rules
[rulesets.eslint.rules]
"my-project-specific-rule" = "error"
```

#### Remote File Format

Remote files are partial `cmc.toml` files containing only the relevant ruleset section:

**`rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint/1.0.0.toml`:**

```toml
[rulesets.eslint.rules]
"no-var" = "error"
"prefer-const" = "error"
"eqeqeq" = "error"
"@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any" = "warn"
```

**`rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/tsc/1.0.0.toml`:**

```toml
[rulesets.tsc]
strict = true
```

#### Version Resolution

The remote reference format is: `github:owner/repo/path@version`

Where `path` points to a ruleset directory and `version` specifies which version to use.

**Version types:**

| Version   | Resolution                                                    | Use Case                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `@latest` | Lookup in `rulesets.json` manifest, resolve to latest version | Always use newest rules |
| `@1.0.0`  | Direct file reference: `{path}/1.0.0.toml`                    | Pin to specific version |
| `@main`   | Git branch, then resolve via manifest                         | Development/testing     |

**Resolution flow for `@latest`:**

```
extends.eslint = "github:myorg/repo/rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint@latest"

1. Clone/fetch repo (default branch)
2. Read rulesets/rulesets.json
3. Find entry for "internal/typescript/5.5/eslint"
4. Resolve "latest" → "1.0.0" (from manifest)
5. Fetch rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint/1.0.0.toml
6. Parse and return [rulesets.eslint.rules]
```

**Resolution flow for `@1.0.0` (direct):**

```
extends.eslint = "github:myorg/repo/rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint@1.0.0"

1. Clone/fetch repo (default branch)
2. Directly fetch rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint/1.0.0.toml
3. Parse and return [rulesets.eslint.rules]
```

**Resolution flow for `@main` (branch):**

```
extends.eslint = "github:myorg/repo/rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint@main"

1. Clone/fetch repo at branch "main"
2. Read rulesets/rulesets.json
3. Find entry for "internal/typescript/5.5/eslint"
4. Resolve "latest" → "1.0.0" (from manifest)
5. Fetch rulesets/internal/typescript/5.5/eslint/1.0.0.toml
6. Parse and return [rulesets.eslint.rules]
```

### 2. Rule Merging

#### Description

Merge inherited rules with local rules. Local rules can add new rules but cannot weaken or disable inherited rules.

#### Merge Behavior

| Scenario                             | Result                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Remote has rule, local doesn't       | Use remote rule         |
| Local has rule, remote doesn't       | Use local rule          |
| Both have same rule, same value      | Use value (no conflict) |
| Both have same rule, different value | **Error**               |

#### Conflict Detection

When a local rule conflicts with an inherited rule, the CLI should error with a clear message:

```
Error: Rule conflict detected

  Rule: "no-console"
  Inherited value: "error"
  Local value: "warn"
  Source: github:myorg/standards/rulesets/typescript@v1.0.0

Local rules cannot weaken inherited rules.
To resolve: remove "no-console" from local [rulesets.eslint.rules]
```

Exit code: 2 (configuration error)

### 3. Command Integration

#### `cmc check`

Before running linters:

1. Load local `cmc.toml`
2. If `[extends]` present, fetch and resolve remote rulesets
3. Merge remote and local rules (error on conflict)
4. Use merged config to run linters

#### `cmc generate`

Before generating config files:

1. Load and resolve config (same as check)
2. Generate config files using merged rules
3. Include comment in generated file indicating inheritance:

```javascript
// Generated by cmc - extends github:myorg/standards/rulesets/typescript@v1.0.0
export default [
  // ... merged rules
];
```

#### `cmc audit`

When auditing config files:

1. Load and resolve config (same as check)
2. Compare existing config against merged rules
3. Report mismatches against the full merged ruleset

### 4. Caching

Remote repositories are already cached in `~/.cmc/cache/` by the existing `fetcher.ts`.

For branch references like `@main`:

- Fetch on first use in a session
- Cache for subsequent calls in same session
- User can clear cache with `cmc cache clear` (future feature)

For tag/commit references like `@v1.0.0`:

- Cache indefinitely (immutable reference)

## Technical Specifications

### New Files

- `src/remote/rulesets.ts` - Ruleset fetching and resolution logic

### Modified Files

- `src/config/loader.ts` - Add `resolveExtends()` function, modify `loadConfig()` to call it
- `src/cli/commands/check.ts` - Use resolved config
- `src/cli/commands/generate.ts` - Use resolved config, add inheritance comment
- `src/cli/commands/audit.ts` - Use resolved config

### Types

```typescript
// In src/types.ts or src/remote/rulesets.ts

interface RulesetsManifest {
  schema_version: string;
  rulesets: Record<string, RulesetEntry>;
}

interface RulesetEntry {
  tier: "prototype" | "internal" | "production";
  description: string;
  tool: "eslint" | "ruff" | "tsc";
  format: "toml";
  versions: {
    [version: string]: { file: string } | string; // string for "latest" pointing to version
  };
}

interface ResolvedRuleset {
  source: string; // Original remote reference
  tool: "eslint" | "ruff" | "tsc";
  rules: Record<string, unknown>; // Parsed rules from remote file
}

class RuleConflictError extends Error {
  rule: string;
  inheritedValue: unknown;
  localValue: unknown;
  source: string;
}
```

### Resolution Flow

```
loadConfig(projectRoot)
  ├── Parse cmc.toml
  ├── If extends.eslint exists:
  │     ├── parseRemoteRef(extends.eslint)
  │     ├── fetchRemoteFile(ref, "rulesets.json")
  │     ├── resolveVersion(manifest, path)
  │     ├── fetchRemoteFile(ref, resolved_file)
  │     ├── Parse TOML, extract [rulesets.eslint.rules]
  │     └── Store as inheritedRules.eslint
  ├── If extends.tsc exists:
  │     └── (same flow for tsc)
  ├── If extends.ruff exists:
  │     └── (same flow for ruff)
  ├── mergeRules(inheritedRules, localRules)
  │     └── Throw RuleConflictError on conflicts
  └── Return merged config
```

### Error Handling

## Testing

### Unit Tests

**`tests/unit/rulesets.test.ts`:**

- Parse rulesets.json manifest
- Resolve version from manifest (latest, specific version)
- Merge rules (no conflict)
- Merge rules (conflict detection)
- Error handling for missing entries

**`tests/unit/config-loader.test.ts`:**

- Load config with extends (mocked fetcher)
- Merge inherited and local rules
- Conflict detection

### E2E Tests

**`tests/e2e/extends.test.ts`:**

- `cmc check` with extends (requires test remote repo or mock)
- `cmc generate` with extends
- `cmc audit` with extends
- Conflict error output

### Test Fixtures

Create test fixtures in `tests/e2e/projects/extends/`:

```
extends/
├── cmc.toml          # Config with [extends]
├── local-override/
│   └── cmc.toml      # Config with conflicting local rule (for error test)
```

## Rollout

1. Implement `src/remote/rulesets.ts` with manifest parsing and version resolution
2. Add `resolveExtends()` to `src/config/loader.ts`
3. Add rule merging with conflict detection
4. Update `check` command to use resolved config
5. Update `generate` command to use resolved config
6. Update `audit` command to use resolved config
7. Add unit tests
8. Add E2E tests
9. Update CHANGELOG.md
10. Release v1.6.0

## Out of Scope

- `cmc cache clear` command (future feature)
- Nested inheritance (base extends another base) - deferred to v3.0.x
- Multiple inheritance sources per linter - deferred to v3.0.x
- Override mechanism to intentionally differ from base - future feature
- Community registry of public rulesets - separate feature
